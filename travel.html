      <p>I've recently taking up traveling as a hobby. Some of the places I've really enjoyed visiting are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Taiwan (all of it) -- there's so much more to do and see than you would probably imagine. Not to mention the food is amazing and the people are extremely nice!</li>
        <li>Huangshan (Yellow Mountain), China -- It was a bit of trek getting out there, but being there and exploring the mountains was amazing.</li>
        <li>Mount Fuji, Japan -- Amazing place to visit to see the more rural, simpler side of Japan. I didn't have time to climb the mountain, so I'll have to come back another time but I at least was able to see the lights of monks and others climbing it over night far away from where I was. Simply incredible.</li>
